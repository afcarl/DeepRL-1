#DeepRL

This code implements the algorithm of deep Q-learning with Experience Replay for playing simple games.

Learning algorithm implemented in this code is from the Google DeepMind's paper **Playing Atari with Deep Reinforcement Learning**[[link](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~vmnih/docs/dqn.pdf)]

## Requirement

DeepRL is implemented with [Torch](http://torch.ch) and the packages of its ecosystem. This code is well worked on my Mac Pro with CPU (I haven't tested it on Linux and GPU). You should install [Torch7](https://github.com/torch/torch7) firstly, then you can install the following packages by **luarocks**

```bash
luarocks install nn
luarocks install image
luarocks install qt
luarocks install optim
```

## Running

You can run this code by tapping the command in the project dir.

```lua
qlua main.lua
```

The result looks like

I got the accuracy of `93.2%` (932 success of 1000 steps).

## Code 

The `envir.lua` indicates the environment in reinforcement learning stage, which receives the action and produces the states and reward for agent.

The `agent.lua` is the agent class which receives the states and reward to produce the action directed by the policy network.

The `learner.lua` is the algorithm of deep Q-learning with experience replay as the following.

## MISC

I completed this code when I was an intern at [Horizon Robotics](http://www.horizon-robotics.com/index_en.html). I will greatly thank the article of [Andrej Karpathy](https://karpathy.github.io/2016/05/31/rl/) and other implementations:[SeanNaren's code](https://github.com/SeanNaren/TorchQLearningExample) and [EderSantana's gist](https://gist.github.com/EderSantana/c7222daa328f0e885093).
